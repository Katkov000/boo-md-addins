UnityScript
========

A JavaScript implementation based on the Boo programming language.

Building the MonoDevelop addin
=======================

Create a build.properties file and configure the md.bin.dir property to
point to the directory containing the MonoDevelop binaries. For instance:

	<?xml version="1.0"?>
	<project>
		<property name="md.bin.dir" value="/Applications/MonoDevelop.app/Contents/MacOS/lib/monodevelop/bin" /> 
	</project>

And then:

	nant md

This will build and copy the required assemblies to ~/.config/MonoDevelop/addins/UnityScript.
